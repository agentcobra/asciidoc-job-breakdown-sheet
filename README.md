AsciiDoc Job Breakdown Sheet
============================

Description
-----------

A template along with its CSS stylesheet to write Job Instruction Breakdown Sheet in Asciidoc.

Documentation is particularly important in FabLab, makerspaces, and hackerspaces, be it for machines usage or project reproduction.
So after researching of how to have better instruction manual, I found very few documents: a military manual for job instructors and
TWI Job Instruction Breakdown Sheet (See [bibliography](#bibliography)).

Still, using dedicated software or even advanced text editor can be tedious, that is one of the reason for the existence of [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).
This project aims at providing templates that are:
* easy to write (plain text),
* help to focus on important instructions,
* produce nice looking documentation in several formats.
